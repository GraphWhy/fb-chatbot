Well.. that was unexpected.
I'm not sure what to think of that. You can type 'Help' to see some instructions.

Hopefully someone checks the logs to figure out what you are saying.
I am not the smartest chatbot.
:/
I think I am missing something, I don't understand.
You should really type "help".
I am not sure what I am saying right now.

Ok, i don't know what you are saying.
At some point you will get a message that says "question of the day: (question here)". When that happens type "answer:(your answer here)"
......
*frustrating experience starting now*
If you were not expecting this answer type "help".
